//////////////Shohy's customized adjustment platform v0.1///////////////

Some customized adjustments can be carried by this platform as modules. The platform is activated on combat and casting, allowing adjustments of each carried module to take effect.
While not in battle, the platform shuts down immediately after making necessary adjustments, in order to save game resources. 

Modules carried now: 
1. Extra modifiers of Intelligence/Wisdom/Charisma.
2. Attributes of enemies grow with experience or level of the protagonist; Give the last attacker a certain amount of experience when an enemy dies.
3. Rebalance for Weapon Styles and Detailed Ajustments for Weapon Types;
4. Fixing Saving throws BUG for Lecgacy of Bhaal difficulty; Enemies cast innate abilities, and elevate their levels with the protagonist.

A blue button of is obtained in innate ability bar in the first battle. Click it to open settings of the platform and each module, and to read the detailed explanation of each module. You can also choose to shut down the entire platform.

If the entire platform is turned off, the carried modules will also be invalid. There are two exceptions:
The first is the permanent effect. The creatures affected by permanent effects will not be restored by shutting down the platform.
The second is that adjustments of some modules are not realized through the platform, only their setting options are placed in the platform. 

Note: Some modules included in this platform were previously independent MODs. Do not install this platform with such independent MODs (such as Weapon Style Rebalance), as conflicts may arise.
