When the protagonist's leveling up is faster than a single-class fighter, his class level of 1/6/10 corresponds to the 'difficulty level' 1/2/3; after that, every 2 class levels he obtains, the 'difficulty level' increases by 1, until the class level is capped; then the increasing of 'difficulty level' is based on the experience value (same as the fighter class).
